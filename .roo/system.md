# Project-Specific Instructions

When working on this project:

- Use ONLY the folder v2 for all development work
- Ignore everything in the v1 folder - this is legacy code that should not be modified or referenced
- This is a Vue application for soccer substitution management
- All state is stored in local storage

## Development Best Practices

- Follow Vue.js composition API patterns
- Don't use typescript
- Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop views
- Organize components into logical folders (UI, features, layouts)
- Add JSDoc comments to functions and components
- Use Vuex/Pinia for complex state management if needed
- Implement proper error handling for localStorage operations
- Write unit tests for critical business logic
- Ensure all UI components have proper accessibility attributes
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use CSS variables for consistent theming

## Code Generation Guidelines

- When generating code, include explanatory comments
- Prefer composition API over Options API
- Use Vue's reactive() and ref() appropriately
- Include proper type annotations
- Implement error handling for localStorage access
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
